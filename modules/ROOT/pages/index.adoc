= Introduction
:use-kroki: 1

https://github.com/wfouche/Tulip[Tulip] is a Kotlin SDK to create load testing, stress testing, and performance regression testing benchmarks for software systems.
Tulip is a robust solution for evaluating the performance and stability of web applications under varying conditions, ensuring they can handle high traffic and stress levels efficiently.
Similar to well-known tools like JMeter, Gatling, and Locust, Tulip provides powerful capabilities to simulate real-world scenarios and generate comprehensive reports, helping developers identify and resolve potential bottlenecks.

== Program structure

A Tulip benchmark program consists of four parts:

. Benchmark configuration file specifying benchmark scenarios to be tested
. User class that implement actions to be benchmarked
. App class that activates the Tulip runtime
. Tulip runtime .jar file available from Maven Central

The Tulip runtime is written in https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin].
Tulip benchmark programs (App and User classes) can be written in any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) programming language.
The following languages are currently supported:

* Java, Kotlin, Scala
* Groovy, Jython
* Clojure (in development)

== Coordinated Omission

Tulip resolves the infamous https://redhatperf.github.io/post/coordinated-omission/[Coordination Omission] problem.
It reports internal wait-time separately from external wait-time (service time).
This is a reporting capability unique to Tulip.

Tulip uses https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/[HdrHistogram] to display Latency by Percentile Distribution graphs.
