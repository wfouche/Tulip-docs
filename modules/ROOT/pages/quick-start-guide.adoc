The best and quickest way to get started with Tulip is to try out the sample benchmark program.

== Demo Benchmark

=== Step 1—new benchmark

Run the following command to create the Java version of the example benchmark program:

* `jbang tulip-cli@wfouche init Java`

This command create files and directories as shown below:
----
├── benchmark_config.jsonc
├── io
│   └── tulip
│       ├── App.java
│       └── HttpUser.java
├── run_bench.cmd
└── run_bench.sh
----

=== Step 2—run benchmark

Thereafter run script

* `run_bench.sh` (Linux or macOS), or
* `run_bench.cmd` (Windows)

to start the benchmark program.
While the benchmark program is running the `benchmark_output.json` file is incrementally updated with benchmark results.

=== Step 3—view results

Once the benchmark is finished, a benchmark report is automatically generated from the benchmark output file.
The benchmark report file is called `benchmark_report.html`. The benchmark script displays the benchmark report on the console using the lynx text web browser utility (as shown below).

Open the `benchmark_report.html` file in a browser to view the benchmark results.

== Fatjar Packaging

The demo benchmark can be packaged into a single self-contained JAR file using command:

* `jbang export fatjar io/tulip/App.java`

The benchmark program and runtime are packaged into jar file `App-fatjar.jar` and can then be run with command:

* `java -jar App-fatjar.jar`, or with additional JVM settings as

* `java -server -Xms2g -Xmx2g -XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational -jar App-fatjar.jar`


Files `App-fatjar.jar` and `benchmark_config.jsonc` can be copied to another machine
if the benchmark program needs to be run elsewhere.
