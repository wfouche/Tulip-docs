[NOTE]
====

Prerequisites::

* https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/[OpenJDK] 21 or later version is installed

* https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] 0.121.0 or later version is installed

* [optional] https://lynx.invisible-island.net/current/index.html[Lynx] text web browser is used to print a text-only version of the  benchmark report to the display console.

* [optional] https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/[Scala-cli] is installed to run the Scala example benchmark program

* Tulip has been tested and works on Linux, Windows, or MacOS

====

== Overview

The best and quickest way to get started with Tulip is to try out the sample benchmark program.

=== Step 1 - new benchmark

Run the following command to create the Java version of the example benchmark program:

* `jbang tulip-cli@wfouche init Java`

=== Step 2 - run benchmark

Thereafter run script

* `run_bench.sh` (Linux or MacOS), or
* `run_bench.cmd` (Windows)

to start the benchmark program.

While the benchmark program is running the `benchmark_output.json` file is incrementally updated with benchmark results.

=== Step 3 - view results

Once the benchmark is finished, a benchmark report is automatically generated from the benchmark output file.
The benchmark report file is called `benchmark_report.html`. The benchmark script displays the benchmark report on the console, if the lynx text web browser utility is installed (as shown below).

Open the `benchmark_report.html` file in a browser to view the benchmark results.
